One day when he was feeling confident enough to come out from under his disgusting bridge, he found a penny. This was an ordinary penny that had Abraham Lincoln on it. He went to get is usually coffee out of the coffee volcano when all of a sudden, there was a loud boom. "Kachow!" Kevin died that day and no one every got to hear his stories on how he would slay the ants that crawled in his trash can.</p>
